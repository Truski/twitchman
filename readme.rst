Twitch Manager
##############

Twitch Manager (TwitchMan or T-Man in short) is an web application that runs
on the streaming PC for stream managers. It is built specifically for a
Super Smash Bros stream, but it can be adapted to many games and genres.
The program's purpose is to easily update a stream's layout involving current
matches and other information. Twitch Manager has Challonge integration and
is built upon CodeIgniter 3 for rapid development.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
